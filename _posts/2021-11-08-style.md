This is my experience creating the style of this blog.

To start out, I really wanted to try something new with the layout of my blog, instead of sticking with Primer. After taking a look at the different options, I chose to go with slate, which I liked because I tend to always choose dark mode when prompted. While this is partly stylistic, I also have sensitive eyes, so it is much easier for me to see dark colors on a webpage. I successfully changed the font colors just for fun to red, but ended up switching it back to gray so that the blue text would pop more.
