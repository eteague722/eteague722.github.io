Howdy! My name is Elizabeth Teague, and here is a little bit about me. Some background about my life is that I am a third generation Aggie, I was homeschooled all the way through high school, and I love traveling. My favorite place that I have traveled was Southern France, specifically Marseilles. In 2018, I had the unique opportunity to travel to Marseilles with my high school French teacher. It was an incredible experience, and I hope to go back someday.
